##  Project Title
**Decision Tree-Based Loan Repayment Classification**

##  Internship Details
- **Company**: CodTech IT Solutions

##  Project Description

This project implements a **Decision Tree Classifier** to predict whether a loan applicant is likely to repay their loan. Using a supervised machine learning approach, we analyze patterns in the dataset to determine the financial behavior of applicants and make binary predictions: **loan repaid** or **defaulted**.

---

##  Dataset

The dataset used contains various features related to the borrower's profile, such as:
- Gender
- Marital Status
- Income
- Credit History
- Education
- Loan Amount
- Loan Term
- Property Area
- Loan Status (Target variable)

> Note: The dataset is cleaned and preprocessed before training the model. Null values are handled, and categorical variables are encoded appropriately.

---

##  Technologies Used

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn (DecisionTreeClassifier, train_test_split, etc.)
- Matplotlib & Seaborn (for visualization)

---

##  Model Details

- **Algorithm**: Decision Tree Classifier
- **Training/Test Split**: 80/20
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, Classification Report
- **Visualization**: Decision Tree structure is visualized for better interpretability.

---
###  Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python installed along with the following libraries:
pandas,numpy,scikit-learn,matplotlib,seaborn

## Results

The Decision Tree Classifier achieved a good level of accuracy in predicting loan repayment status. Here are the key findings:

-  **Model Accuracy**: ~93.67% on the test dataset.
-  **Confusion Matrix**: Provided a clear view of false positives and false negatives.
-  **Classification Report**: Showed balanced precision, recall, and F1-score across both loan repayment outcomes.
-  **Decision Tree Visualization**: Helped in understanding which features most influenced the prediction (e.g., credit history, income).

The model demonstrates a promising ability to support financial institutions in assessing applicant risk levels.
